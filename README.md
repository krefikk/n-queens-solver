# N-Queens Solver
A program which you can solve n-queens problem with any method you want.

# What is N-Queens problem?
The N-Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

# Description
With this program you can solve the N-Queens problem with 4 different approaches, for each board size, and track the elapsed time, and therefore the efficiency of the approach.<br>
Brute Force: Checks all possible board positions<br>
Optimized 1: If a queen is placed in a row, no other queen is placed in that row. This reduces the number of controlled boards and increases efficiency.<br>
Optimized 2: If a queen is placed in a row or a column, no other queen is placed in that row or column.<br>
Backtracking: With the backtracking approach, it quickly obtains valid board states by memorizing the states it has checked.
